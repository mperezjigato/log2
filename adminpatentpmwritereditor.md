Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a surface scientist by training, with an experimental PhD and many years of experience in scientific research by means of first principles quantum mechanical calculations of solids, surfaces and nanostructures.

I must emphasize my writing skills, as evidenced by my publication record, as well as my expertise in research project writing (see enclosed document). Moroever, my expertise in High Performance Computing, Linux, BASH, AWK, Fortran, Python (Jupyter), Matlab (Chebfun), Mathematica, Github, Markdown and Latex must be highlighted. It is worth mentioning, likewise, that I am a quality oriented person who has been constantly praised for hard working by my colleagues and managers, as well as for my flexibility towards change and for taking initiative.

As a research scientist who has always brought his analytical mind to bear on Physics, Chemistry and Materials Science, and who has, in turn, developed a solid skill set over the years, I would like to emphasize that my profile perfectly matches the requirements of this opening. Finally, let me describe myself as a team player who can work independently, as as an organised person with good communication skills, whilst reading Spanish Literature is my main pastime.
